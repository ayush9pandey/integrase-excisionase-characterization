# Integrase-Excisionase Characterization in TX-TL
Data and models repository for paper on [Characterization of integrase and excisionase activity in cell-free protein expression system using a modeling and analysis pipeline](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00534). 

Instructions to run the Jupyter notebooks:
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from your terminal.

Or, if you prefer to install everything manually, you can:
1. Install biocrnpyler: `pip install biocrnpyler>=1.1.1`
2. Install bioscrape: `pip install bioscrape>=1.2.0`
3. If Step 2 fails, you can clone the [Bioscrape](https://github.com/biocircuits/bioscrape/) repository and manually install the package. Run `python setup.py install` to install bioscrape once you meet all the [installation requirements](https://github.com/biocircuits/bioscrape/wiki/Installation).
6. Install autoreduce: `pip install autoreduce`
7. Install seaborn for plotting: `pip install seaborn`
7. Run the jupyter notebooks! 

You can get started with the models using the [Get Started.ipynb](https://github.com/ayush9pandey/integrase-excisionase-characterization/blob/main/Getting%20started.ipynb) notebook. For all of the modeling details, you can run the individual notebooks for integrase and excisionase modeling or data analysis.

If you run into any issues, please feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/ayush9pandey/integrase-excisionase-characterization/issues).
